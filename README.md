# MAP1_MPXreplacement
Replacement map sensor for the obsolete MPX4250AP and similar.
The MAP1 sensor pcb uses the same footprint pinout as the mpx4250ap sensor which is now no longer manufactured.
The MPXHZ6250A style smd sensor is mounted on a pcb that mounts into the legacy throuhhole footprint with the vacuum hose exiting horizontally,
